# Capture-Me
Capture-Me is a screenshot attack ÃÅto investigate the security risks of the password visibility feature on Android platform with the mobile banking applications. I used different techniques to take the screenshot images and I applied highly efficient Optical Character Recognition (OCR) analysis using tesseract-ocr engine to extract the user credential from the taken screenshot images.
